                        <h3>Medium For Propagating Ideologies</h3>
                        <p>What is an idea without an audience? What is an ideology without any listeners? What is a leader without any followers? Adolf Hitler famously utilized his remarkable public speaking skills to captivate audiences, reaching the masses through radios, televisions, or newspapers the following day for those without immediate access. Every leader requires a medium to propagate their ideas and persuade followers to believe in their promises. A biased media serves as a crucial tool in political campaigns, while an unbiased media is essential for a democratic nation.</p>
                        <p>Biased journalism by major broadcasters has been a significant factor in the propagation of nationalist ideologies. In both the USA and India, certain mainstream media outlets have been accused of promoting biased narratives that align with far-right ideologies. These outlets often prioritize sensationalism over objectivity, framing news stories in a way that reinforces nationalist sentiments and polarizes public opinion. This biased reporting can contribute to the creation of echo chambers, where individuals are only exposed to information that confirms their existing beliefs, further entrenching nationalist ideologies.</p>
                        <p>The surge of interest in digital media has indeed tended to focus on the more overt and extreme forms of nationalism, often characterized by passion and, at times, hate. Scholars and researchers have sought to demonstrate how these forms of nationalism thrive in the digital environment, pointing to the unique characteristics of digital media that contribute to their proliferation. One key aspect is the reliance on user participation, which allows individuals to engage with and spread nationalist narratives quickly and effectively. Additionally, the formation of algorithm-driven filter bubbles further exacerbates this trend, as individuals are exposed primarily to content that aligns with their existing beliefs and biases, reinforcing extreme nationalist ideologies.</p>
                        <p>However, this narrow focus on extreme forms of nationalism can overlook the subtler ways in which digital media contribute to nationalist sentiments. For example, the use of targeted advertising and personalized content can subtly shape individuals' perceptions and beliefs, nudging them towards nationalist ideologies without their full awareness. Furthermore, the digital landscape provides a platform for the amplification of nationalist narratives, giving them prominence and reach that was previously unattainable.</p>
                        <p>“The media, also referred to as mass media, is a social institution, meaning, it operates as a mechanism for socializing members of society into the norms, values, and beliefs of our culture. Education, family, health care, and government are examples of other social institutions that have an explicit and clear role in maintaining the health and functionality of society. Mass media is categorized as a social institution due to its ability to persuade and inform society through news, movies, shows, commercials, and other content.”  (Patel and Bridgeforth, 359)</p>
                        <p>For the few unbiased journalistic outlets, survival is made difficult by nationalistic ideologists. They employ tactics such as threats to life, restricting coverage rights, or filing frivolous defamation lawsuits against them. Even after risking everything for unbiased journalism, these individuals receive little in return, as they offer facts rather than sensationalized stories.</p>
