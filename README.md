“One attempt to capture how social media may solidify authoritarian tendencies while maintaining the government’s popularity is the concept of informational autocracies: rule primarily through the manipulation of information.” (Trauthig, Martin, & Woolley 17)

Media manipulation has become a powerful tool for political leaders seeking to undermine democratic principles and consolidate power. Through the lens of Donald Trump in the United States and Narendra Modi in India, this project explores how these leaders have used media to fuel far-right ideologies and “proclaim the dawn of a new era of populism, ‘new’ nationalism and neo-authoritarianism”. (Mihelj and Jiménez-Martínez 331)

This project aims to raise awareness among citizens in general and target groups highly susceptible to these misinformation campaigns. “The reliance on social networks as information sources combined to a predilection for sensationalism, the need for constant novelty, the lack of resources for fact-checking and the emphasis on profits over civic responsibility made the mainstream media susceptible to manipulation.” (Caled and Silva 123) The assimilation of readily available narratives by the masses can only be countered through media literacy and the availability of resources to verify information. With elections scheduled to be held this year in both India and the USA, two of the world’s largest democracies, there is a pressing need for widespread awareness campaigns on how to identify false information. To achieve this, we will focus our targeted outreach efforts through AdWords by airing the video documentary in rural areas and tier 2 cities where a general trend of media illiteracy has been observed. Our approach to joining this conversation has been carefully crafted and split into two components, as elaborated below.

**Interactive Website:**
The interactive website component of this project aims to present complex information in an accessible and engaging manner. Utilizing visual, textual, and interactive elements, the website will provide a comprehensive look at the impact of media manipulation on democracy. The product has been named MediaCheck in accordance with its fact-checking capabilities.

**Features:**
Visual storytelling: A series of videos and images will highlight key moments of media manipulation and their impact. Put forth steps people have already taken in the sphere to counter the same and demonstrate the spread of the conversation.

**Fact-Checking Mechanism:**
To promote media literacy, the website will include a fact-checking mechanism. Users can verify the accuracy of news stories and discern credible sources from misinformation. This fact-checker has been implemented using Python’s Pandas library which makes use of logical regression and decision trees to decide whether the piece of information entered is fake or legitimate. The model has been trained with two CSV files of data resourced from Kaggle, one for each fake and legitimate data up to 2020.
